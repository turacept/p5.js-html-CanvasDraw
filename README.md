# Free-Drawing-P5-JS-HTML
This is a simple drawing website, free, anybody can use and should be easy to learn with, 
just extract the package somewhere on your computer and you can start editing the sketch.js, 
and that is where most of the main code is contained, enjoy! :).

**most functionality is done using the p5 library for Javascript (p5.js), and basic HTML and CSS.
